cat FILE
Display the contents of FILE in the shell. FILE is the name of
the file in the current working directory.

cat FILE [> OUTFILE]
Get the content of FILE and put content into file OUTFILE. This creates a new 
file if OUTFILE does not exists and erase the old contents if OUTFILE already 
exists.

cat FILE [>> OUTFILE]
Like the previous command, but appends instead of overwrites.
