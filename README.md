=======================
WHAT IS THIS??

My first repository on GitHub

This is a program that basically mocks the OS File System.

The user can type commands that will be executed. Any output from a command can be redirected to an outfile. 

User can create new directories and change directories. They may be relative to current directory or full paths.

User can view the name of the current directory path.

User can move and copy items from one file/directory to another.

User can create a new string file and overwrite or append to an existing one.

User can get the file at a specified URL, save it to a file and add the file to the current directory.

User can search for lines in a file containing a specified word or pattern. User can search in a directory for all the files containing this pattern. User can view the path of this file and the line that contained this pattern.

User can view  the contents of the current directory,its subdirectories or a specified directory .

User can remove a path.The user can remove multiple paths at once provided it is a directory.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE?

The purpose of this program was to help with understanding how a file system works, i.e file structure, the different file types and how files are stored and accessed.

Also, custom commands were built in order to become familiar with linux commands and to apply Object Oriented Programming concepts.
